# 🏪 Multi-Store SQL Query Engine

> Execute SQL queries across **600+ store databases simultaneously** — get unified results in seconds instead of hours.

Built at **V2 Retail Ltd.** (600+ stores across India) to eliminate manual, store-by-store data retrieval for the HQ analytics team.

---

## 🚩 The Problem

V2 Retail has 600+ stores, each running its own **SQL Server database**. When HQ needed data — sales figures, stock levels, transaction records — analysts had to:

- Query each store database **one by one**, or
- Wait for a **nightly batch sync** that was always stale by morning

For a 600-store chain, this meant hours of manual effort for a single ad-hoc question.

---

## ✅ The Solution

A **FastAPI web application** that takes one SQL query and fires it to all 600+ store databases **in parallel** — simultaneously — then aggregates every result into a single unified table.

**What used to take hours now takes seconds.**

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| ⚡ **Parallel Execution** | Queries all stores simultaneously using asyncio + thread pool |
| 🔒 **Concurrency Control** | Semaphore limits to 60 concurrent connections — safe for the network |
| ⏱️ **Timeouts** | Per-store connect (5s) and query (30s) timeouts — offline stores don't block results |
| 🏗️ **Report Builder** | Drag-and-drop no-code report builder — no SQL knowledge required |
| 📊 **CSV / XLSX Export** | Download full unified results as CSV or Excel |
| 🏥 **Health Monitor** | Live connectivity check — see which stores are online/offline |
| 📝 **Query History** | Log of all executed queries with timing and success/fail counts |
| 🔧 **Store CRUD** | Add, edit, enable/disable stores via web UI — no code changes needed |
| 💾 **Schema Explorer** | Browse tables and columns from any store directly in the UI |
| 📦 **Bulk Import** | Import all 600+ store configs at once via JSON |

### Why `run_in_executor`?

`pyodbc` (the SQL Server connector) is **synchronous and blocking** — it has no async support. Calling it directly inside an `async` function would freeze the entire event loop.

`run_in_executor` runs each blocking DB call in a **thread pool**, keeping the async event loop free to manage all 600 concurrent tasks efficiently.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server) installed on the host machine
- Network access to store SQL Server instances

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MayankSingh1111/multistore-query-engine
cd multistore-query-engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure

Edit `app/main.py` and set your shared credentials:

```python
DEFAULT_USERNAME = "your_username"
DEFAULT_PASSWORD = "your_password"
DEFAULT_DATABASE = "your_db_name"
```

Or set via environment variables:

```bash
set STORE_USER=your_username
set STORE_PASS=your_password
set STORE_DB=your_db_name
```

### Run

```bash
cd app
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions

**Why SQLite for the store registry?**
Using SQL Server for the registry would create a circular dependency — you'd need a DB connection just to find out which DBs to connect to. SQLite is embedded, zero-config, and always available.

**Why cap preview rows at 10,000?**
The browser UI renders the first 10,000 rows for display. Full datasets (potentially millions of rows across 600 stores) are available via the CSV/XLSX export endpoints, which stream directly without loading everything into memory.

**Why not use a connection pool?**
With 600+ unique servers, a persistent connection pool would hold hundreds of open TCP connections. Instead, connections are opened, used, and closed per query — controlled by the semaphore to prevent network overload.

---

## 📈 Impact

- **Before**: Hours of manual store-by-store querying or waiting for nightly sync
- **After**: Any analyst runs a query across all 600+ stores in **under 60 seconds**
- Non-technical MIS staff use the report builder — no SQL knowledge needed
- Live health monitoring shows store connectivity at a glance
